## Projects
During my professional life I've created dozens of creative projects in my spare time:

- MeTheOne, a website to discover talent all over the world - now dead but [still alive this video I made (+650K views)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSnUIxqH3zA)
- Gzaas, a full screen message generator, from 10 years ago, still alive! https://gzaas.com/
- Odi√≥metro, a Twitter hate measure app, built with Vue and Node https://odiometro.es
- Linguaso, to learn languages via comprehensible input watching YouTube videos https://linguaso.com (you'll love this one!)
- ...and many others that are to come yet.

But, most of all, I've helped the companies I've worked for deliver __high quality__ products to their clients.
